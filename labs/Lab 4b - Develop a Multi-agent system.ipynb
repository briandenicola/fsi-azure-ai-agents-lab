    "In this lab, we’ll build a multi-agent system where a team of agents works together to generate detailed analyst reports about corporate finance data. The system consists of three task agents plus an orchestrator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FinanceDataAgent – This agent searches an Azure AI Search index to retrieve recent financial information and performance data for your company.\n",
    "2. AnalystReportAgent – This agent writes a detailed analyst report synthesizing the retrieved data, including insights on financial performance, Finance trends, and risk analysis.\n",
    "3. ValidationAgent – This agent validates that the final report includes a detailed risk assessment.\n",
    "4. FinanceOrchestratorAgent – The orchestrator that communicates with the above agents to create the final analyst report.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Azure AI Agent Service for the individual task agents and Semantic Kernel to build the orchestrator."

      "Response: {\"report_was_generated\": true, \"content\": \"### Analyst Report: Velo Discount Sales Analysis in Europe\\n\\n#### Executive Summary\\n\\nThis report analyzes discount sales data for Velo in Europe, with a specific focus on France and Germany. The data reveals that Germany adopts a generally more aggressive discount strategy compared to France, particularly evident in the Small Business sector. The analysis addresses five key segments: Enterprise, Channel Partners, Government, Small Business, and Midmarket, highlighting significant trends and discrepancies.\\n\\n#### Segment-wise Analysis\\n\\n1. **Enterprise Segment**\\n   - **France:** The discount amount is about 10,000.\\n   - **Germany:** Discounts are slightly higher, approximately 15,000.\\n\\n   **Insights:** \\n   - The enterprise segment, being crucial for large-scale implementations, shows moderate discount strategies aimed at securing high-value deals. Germany's higher discounts may suggest a more competitive environment or strategic market penetration efforts.\\n\\n2. **Channel Partners Segment**\\n   - **France & Germany:** Discounts are nearly zero.\\n\\n   **Insights:** \\n   - This segment's minimal discounting could indicate established market relationships and confidence in value proposition or alternative collaboration incentives beyond discounts.\\n\\n3. **Government Segment**\\n   - **France:** Discounts are around 10,000.\\n   - **Germany:** Slightly higher, approximately 12,000.\\n\\n   **Insights:** \\n   - Discounts in the government sector remain moderate, with Germany again showing a marginally higher figure. This might reflect a strategic approach tailored to meet regulatory requirements while maintaining competitive pricing.\\n\\n4. **Small Business Segment**\\n   - **France:** Discount is about 40,000.\\n   - **Germany:** Significantly higher at 60,000.\\n\\n   **Insights:** \\n   - The Small Business segment reveals a stark contrast in discount strategies, with Germany employing substantial discounts that far surpass those in France. This aggressive pricing may be designed to capture market share and support SMEs in adopting Velo's offerings, potentially reflecting differing economic conditions or growth strategies.\\n\\n5. **Midmarket Segment**\\n   - **France & Germany:** Discounts are nearly zero.\\n\\n   **Insights:** \\n   - Similar to Channel Partners, the negligible discounts in the Midmarket segment suggest a stable customer base or the presence of other competitive advantages that reduce reliance on discounting.\\n\\n#### Key Observations\\n\\n- **Germany** adopts a more aggressive discount strategy across most segments, particularly in the Small Business sector. This could be driven by market competition, economic conditions, or strategic goals to gain a foothold in this area.\\n- The **Enterprise** and **Government** segments show moderate discount levels, reflecting controlled competitive moves, possibly to avoid price wars while nurturing relationships with these crucial sectors.\\n- Minimal discounts in the **Channel Partners** and **Midmarket** segments suggest strong market positioning, possibly benefiting from customer loyalty or a robust value proposition.\\n\\n#### Strategic Recommendations\\n\\n- **For Velo in Germany**: Continue leveraging aggressive discounts in the Small Business segment to drive growth but evaluate the potential long-term impacts on profitability. Monitor competitive actions and adjust strategies for other segments as necessary.\\n  \\n- **For Velo in France**: Consider enhancing discount strategies in the Enterprise and Government segments to remain competitive. Explore alternative incentive structures for Channel Partners and Midmarket customers to strengthen relationships without heavy discounting.\\n\\n- **Unified Strategy Considerations**: Both countries could benefit from exploring non-price-based competitive strategies, such as superior customer service, improved product offerings, or strategic partnerships, to sustain and enhance market position.\\n\\nThis report provides a granular view of Velo's discount strategies across segments in France and Germany, insights that can shape future strategic directions to optimize market performance.\"}\n",
